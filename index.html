      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>

      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I have this desire to know how things work from an IT/technical perspective and have been incredibly frustrated when things like websites don't work the way they should. Gaining skills in this area is more about managing my own levels of anxiety and frustration and being able to fix things and build things properly.</p>
